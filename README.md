# Gamesolver

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/1e3ee12d4b144e29af67f20391263120)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/nriva/gamesolver/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=nriva/gamesolver&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Small and naive framework for building solver for board games.
Made with TypeScript, Node and Bootstrap for the Web UI.

**Version**: 0.6.0

Three examples are available:

1. Solitaire
2. Sudoku
3. Tic-Tac-Toe

The base classes are in the folder `game-types`.

## Some remarks

Writing such a framework has been revealed harder than I thought. So this _framework_ cannot be thought as finished.
